I was born and brought up in a small village here and had my high school education from a village school nearby. It was only by the final year of college that, I started to engage with technology communities around me, attending technology related events and grew into an active part of the tech communities here in Kerala.</p><p>I became an enduring member of FOSS Kerala, a regional community of people who support and contributes to Free and Open Source software. In the first few meetups, I was literally silent because I had no clue on what was going on and on what they were discussing. All I did was that I took notes and when I was back home, Iâ€™d Google and read. I came to realize that Iâ€™ve studied all these in my high school classes. So I looked up my high school computer education syllabus and I was stunned! All these years I had all this in my syllabus, but I had no clue on what was exactly being taught. So I was curious on how it is now, is it still the same? Are kids still being taught the same way?</p><p>This was the time I started contributing to Pehia Foundation, a small organization helping women and underrepresented groups of society to involve more in technology. I had a talk with the headmaster of the school that I studied in and he granted me the permission to take a session on Free and Open Source Software.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-1.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>As I continued teaching the kids, I understood that our education system is still a long way from helping the students survive in this tremendously changing world. But they were super curious. They didnâ€™t know what open-source was, that people were contributing from all around the globe to build these awesome tools, let alone that they were using it. I talked a bit about their syllabus and how our little state is considered to be far ahead of other states in terms of computer literacy. We have a beautiful and at the same time a very powerful syllabus for our students, IT@School but still its not reaching the children in the right way.</p><p>Especially considering how weâ€™re discussing privacy &amp; data protection and how important it is, in this day and age, and our kids were being exposed to the right tools without them knowing. Super cool isnâ€™t it?</p><p>After talking a bit about what FOSS is and how it is important, I mentioned the recent (2017) judgment about privacy as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court of India and to my surprise, they were all aware of it, but lacked clarity. It was really interactive since they knew a little bit here and there, and they were really curious to know more and didnâ€™t hesitate to ask questions, which again surprised me. And they were really interested to know more. What else did I need? :)</p><p>I was really glad to share the information I knew, and honestly after hearing their questions, I felt like I really underestimated these children. I should have researched a bit more. Also, I tried to bring out their views about the Privacy Act &amp; Aadhaar issues.</p><p>The conversation ended up being really interactive, and we talked about things like how Aadhaar infringes on rights of an individual and how does Facebook decide what to show on your news feeds, how it gathers information and serves you ads based on that.</p><hr /><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-63.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><blockquote><p>The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. <cite>Coretta Scott King</cite></p></blockquote><p>It was a moment of realization, Iâ€™ve always wanted to contribute to STEM education for children and I wanted to open the world of opportunities out there for them. Computers as a tool and how to use them have become an essential 21st century skill. But all I see is everyone trying to make software engineers, but I wanted the children to be able to use computers as an effective tool to augment their line of work, be it health, finance or engineering. Teach them how to break down complex problems, refine their line of thought and build problem solving skills.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-64.gif" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>To accomplish this, there is a need to reach out to schools, create peer learning groups and provide a level ground for children from different schools, different places, different backgrounds to gather around on a single table and discussing technology by letting them build things, share knowledge, learn new things, and provide them with proper mentor-ship and domain awareness by connecting them to the industry.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-65.png" alt="Placeholder" /> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-66.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><blockquote><p>Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.</p></blockquote><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-67.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>To manage and run something like this at scale Iâ€™ll need to work on my interpersonal, management and organizational skills, Iâ€™ll need help learning how to source funds, identify need and channeling the right resources to need and requirement. For this I could use all the help that I can get.</p><p>Iâ€™m always available on email (r k [dot] s r e e p r i y a [at] g m a i l [dot] c o m). Ping me if you could help me out in anyway, or if you are interested in the story I just told and what to know more. :)</p><blockquote><p>The way to change the world is through individual responsibility and taking local action in your own community.</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
