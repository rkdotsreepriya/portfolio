She was a first-year IT student at that time. I went there to attend a ReactJS workshop organized by FOSS Club Kerala. It was the first workshop I ever attended and to my knowledge, it was the first workshop Enfa organized at her college. The workshop went very well and I met a lot of new people who are a good friend of mine now.</p><p>Thanks to FOSS Club STAS(School of Technology and Applied Sciences), where I got the updates regarding the technical workshops nearby.</p><p>After the ReactJS workshop and networking session, when Enfa sends me off with a sweet ‚ÄúGood Bye!‚Äù I never thought of meeting her again. But destiny has planned something else for us. I met her again on another technology meet-ups. And we used to see each other every weekend at some events or workshops or meet-ups and become friends. I haven‚Äôt seen any girls rather than us in events or workshop.</p><p>That‚Äôs the time the <a href="https://studevsoc.com">Student Developer Society</a> has formed. Levi, my senior‚Äôs initiative. SDS is celebrating its second birthday today. Congratulations Levi and thank you so much for introducing me to the community world.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-59.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>I took my initial community lessons for SDS. From how to keep your community members active to organize events. With the help of a few like-minded people, we decided to host the inaugural ceremony at our college STAS.</p><p>To my surprise, Venkat sir, ( mentor of Sds) selected me to be in the core group of SDS, Enfa as well selected as the core member of SDS.Me, Enfa, Prejith, Jesvin Levi, Venkat, and Ajin Jude. We were the team! We organized monthly meetups and workshops.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-60.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Initially, SDS was WhatsApp group (currently the main group is in telegram Join: @studevsoc). Students and professionals from different places joined the group. People started posting events happening in and around Kerala, and discussions on different topics occurred. SDS is very special to me.</p><p><cite> Two years ago, we embarked on a journey with a unique mission. To bridge the gap between students and professionals and to empower the students with a taste of the professional world.Today, our journey still continues. We have sailed across various obstacles, various chapters, dark phases and challenges. Yet, we sail strong. We have achieved and done a lot, but we know we have a lot more to explore. We have many more chapters to come, many more phases to pass, many more obstacles to jump over and many more challeges to come. Our journey towards our goal continues‚Ä¶Happy 2nd Birthday Student Developers Society.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLevi, Founder SDS </cite></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-61.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Our friendship grew with SDS. Core meetings, organizing meetups, attending events, we were everywhere together.</p><p>Finally, we both got selected for a three-day hackathon organized by ICFOSS, TVM. I was pretty sure when I got the selection mail, that my parents are not going to allow me to go for this event. Enfa faced the same issue. We decided to go together. Still, that wasn‚Äôt enough for our families. After so much effort of talking to our parents, they together come to a decision that my parents will take us to Trivandrum and they will come to take us back too. The journey we started from there is still going on!</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholer-62.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
