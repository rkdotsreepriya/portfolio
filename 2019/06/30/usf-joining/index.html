It was like a dream come true. Most girls I know want to live independent life, to live alone, to take care of herself, to live without the help from their family both morally and financially and to take the responsibility for their own decisions. At least this is what I wanted in my life.</p><h2 id="city-of-dreams">City of Dreams!</h2><p>I reached Mumbai on May 10th. I felt happy when I saw Henna(the founder of Universe Simplified, whom I‚Äôm going to work for the next two years) waiting for me in front of her house. I wanted to hug Henna the very first moment I met her, but I didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what stopped me from doing so. She had set up everything for me. Even though she dislikes cooking, she had set up a mini kitchen and everything I needed. A simple thank you is not enough to thank her.</p><p>The place is called Dombivli and her house was a seven minutes walk from the local train station and fifteen minutes walk from my office. The market in Dombivli is near the railway station, so basically everything I need is at the doorstep.</p><p>With me, my Amma &amp; Brother were there. We used to go out every evening and have a walk around. To get a glimpse of this city which is unknown to us.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-44.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-45.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-46.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-47.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>When I send off my amma and brother back home, I was actually excited rather than been scared. It was really crazy to think that now I‚Äôm in Mumbai, I don‚Äôt know the local language(Marathi), I don‚Äôt anyone here(No relatives, no friends), I‚Äôm all alone in this unknown hectic city. Others will find this scary but I find it really challenging and adventurous.</p><p>My day starts with an exercise which Henna suggested to me for strengthening my knees and thighs ( since I‚Äôve ligament injury issues, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to climb stairs and walk continuously). Then cooking. This is the part which I and Henna hate. We both don‚Äôt know how to cook and we find it boring and time-consuming. But our circumstances forcing us to cook. What to do!</p><h2 id="then-office">Then office.</h2><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-48.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>It‚Äôs only a 10 minutes walk to the office from where we stay. I saw the Dombivli market and Henna‚Äôs chai shop. Henna is a chai addict. I really wanted to try chai there but I didn‚Äôt. I miss The chaiwallah.in very much. I wish they had a branch here with the same vibrant atmosphere.</p><h3 id="my-office-universe-simplified-foundation">My office: Universe Simplified Foundation</h3><p>Story of why Universe Simplified was started by Henna Khan. When Henna was a kid she was really interested in astronomy but that passion was lost because our education system did not encourage questions and nurture and child‚Äôs curiosity. The focus was on rote learning with the intention of clearing exams. Many years later while working at her family business that passion came back and Universe Simplified was born with the intention of taking hands-on astronomy workshops for children so that they get a platform to explore their interest further and to ignite the spark of curiosity in children. Meera joined USF at the very beginning and both Henna and Meera made the first set of projects to take to the schools. When they started working in schools they realized that over all these years nothing has changed and that science was still being taught through textbooks. So they set up hands on, which was focused on clearing the child‚Äôs concept. That‚Äôs a bit about USF.</p><h3 id="my-first-day-at-office">My first day at office</h3><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-49.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>It was full of excitement. I was curious to know about my work and all. I met Sonali(Operations Intern), Sneha(HR Intern) and Anna (Innovation Fellow). Me and Anna are going to work together for the next two years at the ground level, managing innovation hubs, and training interns, etc. The fun part is Anna is a local and speaks Marathi &amp; Hindi only. And me the second fellow, from Kerala and don‚Äôt know a single Marathi word and struggles in speaking Hindi. It was a question mark for everyone about how these fellows are going to communicate!</p><p>We‚Äôre a team of six people and twenty plus interns.</p><p>The first thing they asked me was ‚Äú What do you want to achieve in the next two year? Apart from the fellowship what do you want to learn? Think, make a list and tell us. We will help you.‚Äù I was amazed, surprised and I don‚Äôt have any words to explain the happiness I felt. How many organization think about their team member‚Äôs personal development? USF, they‚Äôre not only concentrating on the kids‚Äô education but the team members also. Every team member of USF has weekly tasks to complete on personal development. And we‚Äôve beautiful weekly reflections.</p><h3 id="about-reflections">About reflections</h3><p>There are mainly four key values UFS follow.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-50.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><ol><li>Compassion</li><li>Ownership</li><li>Integrity</li><li>Innovation</li></ol><p>So on weekly reflections, each team member will share their weekly experience. And each member will try to follow these four values as possible and discuss on which value we need to improve.</p><h2 id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking</h2><p>In every team meeting, we‚Äôve got a critical thinking task. Each time one team member will research on any critical thinking task and other members have to do it. USF promotes critical thinking and design thinking.</p><h3 id="work-mode-on">Work mode ON!</h3><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-51.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>The date of joining was in April, but I couldn‚Äôt join at that time here because of some commitments I had already made. Since I had joined late,I only had half the time to finish the training. The training is basically making of small science-electronics projects. Training is inquiry-driven and hands-on. I‚Äôve to make projects and document on my learning and the improvements that can be made in the future.</p><p>Here the schools start on the second week of June. Before the schools started, we hosted a selection workshop for the volunteers. The workshop was really a fun and exciting. The volunteers do hands-on projects without the help of the internet.</p><p>If we get a problem to solve, the first thing we do is to search for solutions on the internet and we apply an existing solution. Where is the innovation in this? Innovation comes only when we start thinking and sadly people have have started doing less of that. Everyone is lazy to use their brains, lazy to think.</p><p>During the intern selection workshop, they were asked to make a Rubber Band Plane, seems simple enough, right? But it took me roughly 9 hours to make one.</p><p>While observing them making the project, it was hilarious. They came up with different ideas that I had never even thought of. The working principle will be the same for every plane, but the design they came up with were different and innovative. Some failed, some quit in the middle and some completed. The task was not to complete it, but to get an understanding of the process, the way they executed the task and to understand the working of the project.</p><p>This is the way everything works at Universe Simplified. We find the problem, then we discuss it, finds solution/solutions, plan it and then execute it. I‚Äôm really in love with our team. We talk about everything. Not just about the education in general, but also politics, love, relationship, gender stereotyping, social structure, family, etc. I feel right at home.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-52.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-53.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
