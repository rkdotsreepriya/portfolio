Sometimes it‚Äôs raining and sometimes it‚Äôs hot.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-35.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h2 id="work">Work</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-36.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Schools have started by the end of June so did our workshops. For the last 6 years USF has been working with different schools and foundations, both in urban and rural areas of Mumbai. I‚Äôm in charge of urban areas. We have 7 innovation hubs all over Mumbai and four innovation hubs are in the urban area and two in rural area. Being an innovation fellow, it‚Äôs my responsibility to take care of these four hubs in the urban area which consists of nine batches.</p><p>We have a diverse set of interns. From Btech students to a retired pharmaceutical sales executive. There is no discrimination on the basis of age, color, gender, etc. The only thing that matters to USF is <strong>CURIOSITY!</strong> Your curiosity to learn new things.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-37.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>One day I was at the office working on a project and Meera, the Cofounder and Program Manager of USF gave me a task to do. I started searching on the internet. <em>‚ÄúSreepriya, I need you to change your learning approach,‚Äù Meera said.</em></p><h3 id="learning-approach">Learning Approach</h3><p>I always end up looking up on Google whenever someone gives me a task to do. What I‚Äôve noticed is that Google always has some solution for your problem and when I read the solution I start thinking in that perspective only. My mind gets influenced by the existing solutions and I never think about solving it in a different approach. This happens every time. Now, I started trying not to rely on the internet too much. I think about the problem, how I can solve this and then design a way to solve the problem. It may not be the best way to solve a problem but still, the problem can be solved this way too. Then I can search on the Internet and find existing solutions and think to compare the solution and arrive at a better conclusion. I‚Äôm able to see the change in my thought process. This is the same thing we do with children. They‚Äôre encouraged to think in their way and design their solution.</p><h3 id="innovation-hubs">Innovation Hubs</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-38.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>I‚Äôm so happy with my job. It‚Äôs not a 9 to 5 job. I only have to work for three days a week. Saturday, Sunday, Monday and one-off day in a week. These three days I‚Äôll be traveling around Mumbai, to Juhu, Lokhandwala, Andheri, and Lower Parel. These are the places where we have our innovation hubs. Rest of the days I will be at our office in Dombivli, making small mechanical projects and learning electronics and programming</p><p>USF has a level-based curriculum, Titanium is the lowest level, then Iron, Copper, and Zinc respectively, for now. Titanium and Iron levels include small mechanical and electronics projects. Children are exposed to making projects using solar panels, motors, LEDs, etc. From balloon-powered car, to a water rocket, children are doing amazing DIY projects. We, facilitators, give hints when they‚Äôre stuck. Children are encourged to do project on their own. We never say what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong. They have the complete freedom to fail and we do celebrate failures at USF. Children are so curious to make things and we are amazed by the ideas they come up with.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-39.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h3 id="the-innovation-hub-managers-interns">The Innovation Hub Managers/ Interns.</h3><p>A bunch of amazing people, with a huge passion for learning, making and sharing their knowledge. They are working as part-time interns. I‚Äôve to observe them and give feedback/suggestion on their facilitation style. Some are extraordinary in facilitating children. They were good at managing children too. Sometimes it‚Äôs really difficult to manage children. Children are very chaotic. I do remember my first session at one of our innovation hub and children were running around all the time. We couldn‚Äôt even talk to them properly because they were not even listening to us. I was able to figure out what to do. I was not prepared enough because I was not expecting this. Then I simply sit in the corner of the classroom and let the children do whatever they want.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-40.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>We are trying to figure out how to deal with these children and it‚Äôs different for different hubs. At some innovation hubs, we start with five minutes of fun activities to gain their attention and for some other hubs, we start with a critical thinking activity which increases the team collaboration between the children.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-41.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>One full-day workshop at ATE Enterprise office, Andheri. It was really fun, making projects and testing it. Everyone has their childish behavior in them. I got to see that while testing the water rocket project, and trying out the water balloon challenge. The duration of this internship is for six months. We are a family right now. Young minds from all over Mumbai coming together to learn new things a Intern Training Day and share their leanings.</p><p>Yeah, that‚Äôs a bit about my work and workspace.</p><h2 id="life-in-mumbai">Life in Mumbai</h2><p>Thanks to Henna for helping me in finding a new place. I‚Äôve always dreamed of about living on my own. It‚Äôs really exciting. Even though I hate cooking, it gives me some sort of pleasure when I cook at night. I‚Äôm more relaxed after cooking and I feel a kind of freshness inside. I become more productive at night. The only problem I‚Äôm dealing right now is my sleeping irregularity and I‚Äôm unsure about what to do with it. Apart from that, I‚Äôm so happy here. I‚Äôm investing more time for myself and I‚Äôm doing something I love.</p><p>I always wanted to learn psychology. Two books which I‚Äôm reading right now is ‚Äú The Power of Habit‚Äù by Charles Duhigg and ‚ÄúWhat did you ask at school today?‚Äù by Kamala V Mukunda. Both books are connected. One is dealing with how the brain works and why we are doing what we do. The other book is a handbook for child psychology. It goes into depth on how the young brains works. Suggestion are welcome for any interesting books related to this.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-42.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
