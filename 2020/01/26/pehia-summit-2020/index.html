I‚Äôm happy that we took a big step initiating this in the second year itself.</p><p><strong>Pehia Summit 2020</strong> was a collective effort of team Pehia with around 15 volunteers from all over Kerala. Volunteers made it happen, I must say, even though they were spamming my inbox with silly doubts. It reminded me about us(Me and Enfa). How unorganized we were and how we organized our very first event. The mistakes we did. I remember the last-minute changes happening every time. No matter how much we plan, something will happen unexpectedly. This time also it happened and it was beyond our control. One of our speaker‚Äôs flight got cancelled and the other got delayed. We were not a pro in organizing events. Organizing such an event in such a short time was exciting. I‚Äôve already exceeded the number of leaves I could take during this year of fellowship. I was worried about my presence at the event. Thanks to Meera and Henna allowing me to join the Pehia Summit 2020(with a not taking leaving policy for next year.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-14.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Starting from volunteers selection, it was fun. We wanted to give the opportunity to newbies. I don‚Äôt know how to thank them. My little sisters! You‚Äôre next, take the lead and inspire others.</p><p>We shared the volunteer registration form only among our closest circles and was open for two days. It was fun scheduling hangouts call with all the twenty registered volunteers. One to one conversation. I appreciate them for their patience during the selection process.</p><p>Even though I haven‚Äôt seen any of our volunteers before. Soon we become a family. They made me realise that I‚Äôm no longer a small girl by calling me ‚Äúchechi chechi‚Äù all the time, even though I have told them to call me by my name. 22! Oh my god, I‚Äôm ageing so fast.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-16.JPG" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>I think things were pretty clear to Me and Enfa this time that we divided the overall responsibility. When I look back, I realise things were more organized than they were. I do remember Enfa calling me and telling me that ‚Äú It seems like everything is done, but still have a gut feeling that there is something that we are missing. ‚Äú</p><p>Everything was just perfect. The team, the energy. Everything!</p><p>I think I should thank each team individually for making this event a remarkable one. Our guests were so impressed with our guest relations team. From the way, they draft their email to their follow up with everything. We got really good feedback from our guests.</p><p>I was never good with creatives. Our deco team have done amazing work. I really love the wings, selfie stand and properties they have made. It did add colours to our event.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-13.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Our official driver, Diya Liza Varghese. You are a rock star, my love. You handled everything alone. Venue team, Food team, Relationship and Partnership team, After Summit team everyone did their best.</p><p>One of the best things I notice in the food team was they did segregate the waste. Thank you guys for doing that. Anyone can acquire knowledge, but the real knowledge comes when you put it into practice. Proud of you.</p><p>Thank you so much my bold and beautiful sisters. Pehia Summit 2020 was yours.</p><h3 id="future-of-pehia-summit">Future of Pehia Summit</h3><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-18.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Personally, I envision Pehia summit as a conference were both the members of our programs and their parents can participate for free of cost. Pehia summit will be an opportunity for everyone to demonstrate their talent. A room for parents to raise their concerns and discuss how we can solve the challenges we face, with the complete support of our families. The moment we (Me and Enfa) had a conversation regarding Pehia annual conference, these are the things that came to my mind. I hope in the coming years Pehia Foundation can do so much in revolutionizing the technology industry as well as the society.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/placeholder-17.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
