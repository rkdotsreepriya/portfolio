If you donâ€™t, now you know one. â˜º</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-54.png" alt="image" /></p><p>From childhood, I was a jack of all trades. In my school days, I always tried to excel in extracurricular activities and as well as in academics. I donâ€™t know when I started manifesting an interest in football. Maybe because of my first crush was a football player at that time. :P I started playing football at the age of 10. I was a very stubborn and proactive child at that time. My family has always supported me in everything I do. They said a clear NO when I talked about me practicing football.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-55.png" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Thatâ€™s the first time they stopped me from doing something that I love. But I never listened to them as I was so stubborn and determined to get whatever I want. I started playing football. Negative comments started popping up one by one. Even from the family itself. The saddest part was, they know I play well and I love playing football, but they donâ€™t want me to go for practice just because Iâ€™m a girl. I fell down.</p><p>But that never stopped me from playing football. When I joined Sacred Heart HSS, Thevara for my higher secondary education, the first thing I searched for was about the womenâ€™s football team but sadly there was only womenâ€™s cricket team. I couldnâ€™t find any other girls playing football and I put a halt for my football dreams.</p><p>One day when I came back home after my class. My mom said that she met her old friend and he was asking about me and how my football practicing going on. I felt really sad. I went into a state of depression. Because of knowing that Iâ€™m simply giving up my dreams without trying. I started thinking about how to restart playing football, where I can do practice, where I will be able to find a coach. When I tried, I found the answers.</p><p>One question remained unanswered. How I will convince my parents? I fast for a few days. I didnâ€™t eat anything, drunk anything for days. I still donâ€™t know why I choose to fast even though it is not a solution to my problem. But it worked. (Note: Doesnâ€™t work always) Finally, my family said that do whatever you want. Still, that was not a YES but it was more than enough for me.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-56.jpeg" alt="image" /></p><p>Finally, back on the field. I was happy and happier when I got selected as a central midfielder for the Alappuzha district team. After hours and hours of trying to convince my family, I went to Wayanad to play the very first Ramco Kerala Womenâ€™s League.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-57.jpg" alt="image" /></p><p>Tragedy struck when I got injured during the match and had to be bed-ridden for a few months. This incident forced me to give in to my familyâ€™s decision and I had to say goodbye to my football dreams. For me, that was a sad phase in my life, but eventually, that incident had a huge part in making me whom Iâ€™m today. I vowed then that I will fight to ensure that girls have the freedom to make their own decisions in life. Thatâ€™s how I become the co-founder of Pehia Foundation.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-58.jpg" alt="image" /></p><p>My parents considered girls playing football as odd because there werenâ€™t any examples for me to show them. The same issue happened with the conferences and workshops. Then I met Enfa, who shared a similar interest to attend events, conferences, hackathons etc, and then we both decided to start Pehia Community. A community for like-minded girls to support each other,to learn and to grow, together for building a better future for everyone.</p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
