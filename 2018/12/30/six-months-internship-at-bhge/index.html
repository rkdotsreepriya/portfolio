Because December 24th, 2018 was my last working day at BHGE. I came here at BHGE with no clue about what I want to go further in my career. And now I‚Äôm leaving here this Christmas Eve with a thought about which field I can excel in.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-69.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>I joined BHGE on last 25th June. I was lucky enough to get an internship at such an MNC very soon after my graduation. My role was to support the new learning portal they‚Äôre building for their new hires and also assisting the Skill Pool Manager of BHGE, Kochi.</p><p>BHGE is spread across two floors of SmartCity, Kochi. I was on the 3rd floor working with the Digital Technology team. Since I was working closely with the Skill Pool Manager, I got to know deep about BHGE, its organizational hierarchy, and tools available in BHGE for employees‚Äô interpersonal skill development.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-70.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h3 id="networks-in-bhge">Networks in BHGE</h3><p>As I understood, BHGE invests a lot in community activities. A worldwide network of Women in Energy, Women in Technology, and Women in Rig are global communities within BHGE. The activities of these communities within BHGE and the recognition they give to women was amazing. BHGE even has a global interns community in Facebook and I got the opportunity to know a few interns working in Digital Technology in BHGE, Houston.</p><p>One thing I mainly liked about BHGE is the hospitality they give to their employees. They have supported me in activities of Pehia Foundation and most importantly they stood by my side when wrong allegations came against me during the flood in Kerala.</p><h3 id="friends-and-colleagues">Friends and colleagues</h3><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-71.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h4 id="interns">Interns!</h4><p>Now we are a family. Four interns, two from north India and two from Kerala. Since I had no clue about the petroleum industry, its history and how much petroleum influences our daily life etc, it was fun and informative working with them. Thanks, Prachi Uppu (my co-intern) for teaching me from the basics. I was her testing material for every domain material she creates for the new learning portal. Her theory was if I could understand the materials they created, then anyone could. And it worked. Now I‚Äôm confident enough to write a petroleum examination. She taught me from the evolution of earth to the latest tools being developed in BHGE for drilling. Off the record, yeah! I‚Äôve got a mini petroleum degree now. üòÇüòÇ</p><h3 id="haseena-manjandavida">Haseena Manjandavida!</h3><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-72.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>She was ex-military and a great personality. It was my pleasure to meet and work with her.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-73.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>The event ‚ÄúUntitled‚Äù conducted by MEC, Thrikkakara, Haseena was a speaker there. And her travel story is really a huge inspiration for every girl who loves to travel ‚Äî especially for the ones who love long bike rides.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-74.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><h3 id="sports-meet">Sports Meet</h3><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-75.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-76.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>I‚Äôm a huge fan of football. I stopped playing football three years ago because I suffered an injury while playing football and my family was too scared to let me play again. And I quit. On BHGE sports day, I had the opportunity to play football again and I really enjoyed the moment. I never thought I would be ever able to play again but I got a chance here.</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-77.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-78.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Finally, the Annual family gathering!</p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-79.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-80.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-81.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>Annual day preparation made me think of my school/college art days. And it was the first time I did a fashion show. Now everyone is calling me ‚ÄúHelen/Monica‚Äù. That was really fun. My last days in BHGE was excellent. I became close to everyone in BHGE. Really, I‚Äôm gonna miss these people. I enjoyed every moment with them.</p><p>The words ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù is not enough to show my gratitude towards Miss Keerthana Krishnan. The one who referred me for this opportunity at BHGE. After my graduation, I had no idea about what I was going to do. It was then I got a message from Geeky Purple Unicorn that there is an opening of an internship at BHGE. I suddenly said yes to her and then I got a call from Zarina, who was working as a Skill Pool Manager, at BHGE.</p><h3 id="zarina-aziz">Zarina Aziz</h3><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-82.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p><img src="/portfolio/assets/images/placeholder-83.jpeg" alt="Placeholder" /></p><p>My first manager and a very supportive woman. A role model I would say. Her personal and professional life has inspired me very much. I love the way she works and the effort she put in to reach higher levels in her career. She is currently working at <a href="https://www.neudesic.com/">Neudesic Business Technology Solution</a> as a Sr. Manager.</p><p>She was never bossy. she helped me to learn and understand new things quickly.</p><p>She was a friend. One day she took me to her new flat and met her family. I could always see that smile of accomplishment on her face. I‚Äôve so much love and gratitude towards her.</p><p>Joining BHGE was a Herculean task. Got a lot of documents to sign and a full health check-up and finally, I joined BHGE on June 25th, 2018.</p><p>Six months!</p><p>It was really a great opportunity I got to learn, understand and explore.</p></div></div></div><div class="section-padding--none"><div class="grid"><hr class="sep"/></div></div><div class="section-padding"><div class="grid-small"> <span class="post__author">Posted by <a href="http://sreepriya.in" title="More By Sreepriya Radhakrishnan">Sreepriya Radhakrishnan</a></span><p class="post__bio"></p></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/26/pehia-summit-2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-12.jpeg" alt="First ever Pehia Summit"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">First ever Pehia Summit</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2020/01/25/pre-summit2020/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-10.jpeg" alt="Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Pehia Foundation Pre Summit 2020</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/portfolio/2019/12/04/usf-fellowship-application/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="/assets/images/placeholder-19.jpeg" alt="Interested in Mentoring Children?
